# Torchwood

A [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf) based colorscheme for [kakoune](https://kakoune.org/).

I made a few modifications to the original, such as using the more vibrant colours more often,
keeping the terminal background, and an addional blue based off Jack's shirt in [this image](https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1493060813/articles/2011/07/05/doctor-who-spinoff-torchwood-heads-to-starz/torchwood-miracle-day-lacob-tease_xpmfoh).
